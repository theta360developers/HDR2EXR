## HDR2EXR Plug-in Installation

Are you in the visual special effects field? Do you own a RICOH THETA V and use it to gather lighting information to apply to CGI models?

Here's a way to install a plug-in in your THETA and save time and effort. One button push gets you 11 bracketed images and outputs an EXR file with the lighting information you need.

This installation information is intended for VFX professionals who own a RICOH THETA V and do not mind a little one-time effort installing and configuring software. However, you do not need to be a developer to use this plug-in.

Quick Overview

The RICOH THETA V 360 degree camera is used regularly in VFX to grab lighting information. It is an extremely portable, high quality, low-cost device that can allow you to jump into a scene on-site without slowing down production. But it still takes some effort configuring the RICOH THETA mobile app on your smartphone/tablet and you need to combine the images later into EXR or other HDR formats.

THE THETA V has the ability to run "plug-ins" (an Android app) inside the camera. These can customize how the camera is used. Often, a plug-in will add multiple pre-defined steps to one button press, saving time and effort.

This HDR2EXR plug-in, developed by Kasper Oerlemans, is not submitted to the THETA Store yet, so it needs to be installed manually. This requires a series of steps which are not hard but take probably 10 minutes for the first-time setup.
