## HDR2EXR Plug-in Installation

Are you in the visual special effects field? Do you own a RICOH THETA V and use it to gather lighting information to apply to CGI models?

With the HDR2EXR Plug-in, one button push gets you 11 bracketed images and outputs an EXR file with the lighting information you need.

### Who can use this?

This installation information is intended for VFX professionals who own a RICOH THETA V and do not mind a little one-time effort installing and configuring software. 

### Quick Overview

The RICOH THETA V 360 degree camera is used regularly in VFX to grab lighting information. It is an extremely portable, high quality, low-cost device that can allow you to jump into a scene on-site without slowing down production. But it still takes some effort configuring the RICOH THETA mobile app on your smartphone/tablet and you need to combine the images later into EXR or other HDR formats.

THE THETA V has the ability to run "plug-ins" inside the camera. These can customize how the camera is used. Often, a plug-in will add multiple pre-defined steps to one button press, saving time and effort.

This HDR2EXR plug-in, developed by Kasper Oerlemans, is not submitted to the THETA Store yet, so it needs to be installed manually. This requires a series of steps which are not hard but take probably 10-15 minutes for the first-time one-time setup.
