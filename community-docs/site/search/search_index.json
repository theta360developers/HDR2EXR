Do you own a RICOH THETA V and use it to gather lighting information to apply to CGI models?\n\n\nWith the HDR2EXR Plug-in, one button push gets you 11 bracketed images and outputs an EXR file with the lighting information you need.\n\n\nWho can use this?\n\n\nThis installation information is intended for VFX professionals who own a RICOH THETA V and do not mind a little one-time effort installing and configuring software. \n\n\nQuick Overview\n\n\nThe RICOH THETA V 360 degree camera is used regularly in VFX to grab lighting information. It is an extremely portable, high quality, low-cost device that can allow you to jump into a scene on-site without slowing down production. But it still takes some effort configuring the RICOH THETA mobile app on your smartphone/tablet and you need to combine the images later into EXR or other HDR formats.\n\n\nTHE THETA V has the ability to run \"plug-ins\" inside the camera. These can customize how the camera is used. Often, a plug-in will add multiple pre-defined steps to one button press, saving time and effort.\n\n\nThis HDR2EXR plug-in, developed by Kasper Oerlemans, is not submitted to the THETA Store yet, so it needs to be installed manually. This requires a series of steps which are not hard but take probably 10-15 minutes for the first-time one-time setup.",
